# Literature Review: Role of AI in Urban Planning and Participation

## Abstract
This review explores the phenomenon of artificial intelligence (AI) in urban planning and governance. It discusses the integration of AI technologies, such as machine learning, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and natural language processing (NLP), in participatory urban design. The paper outlines the benefits of AI in design decision-making, project validation, and evaluation while addressing challenges like transparency, legal accountability, and potential biases in data.

## Background and Motivation
- **Context**: AI's potential to improve urban planning stems from its ability to handle large datasets generated by modern urban systems like transportation, energy, and construction.
- **Problem Addressed**: The complexity of cities has grown beyond human capabilities for analysis and design. AI fills the gap by enabling automated optimization, pattern recognition, and participatory processes.
- **Significance**: As urban systems grow increasingly complex, leveraging AI for smart city initiatives, urban mobility, and participatory planning is critical for sustainable development.
